a nearby gas pipeline and surrounding area via mad news world police were unable to determine why the woman described as an islamic refugee was in possession of the plans but many are fearing the worst the plans detailed a pipeline in deming new mexico the fbi s joint terrorism task force was deployed with the u s border patrol to investigate the area the search came up empty the pipeline identified in the muslim woman s plans is fairly remote leading many to assume that the woman was scouting out potential targets for future terror attacks and did not have immediate intentions to launch an attack it is troubling to discover an undocumented muslim woman in a county sharing a border with mexico a report released by judicial watch in revealed that mexican cartels were working with terror organizations the report indicates that mexican gangs were accepting payments to smuggle foreigners from terror plagued nations into our country judicial watch also revealed in a report that mexico based islamic terror groups have been illegally crossing the border into america to scout out potential targets congress should approve funding for president trump s border wall at once it is not merely a matter of preventing illegal immigration many nefarious groups such as terrorists and drug cartels are aware that the southern border is the easiest way to sneak into america many of the illegal immigrants entering america are not even from mexico instead aliens from south of mexico are able to travel across the country in order to reach the american mexican border many of these aliens receive active support from the mexican government who cannot support the illegal immigrants if a terrorist wanted to sneak into america to launch an attack they could easily travel across the southern border they could start their journey south of mexico arriving in countries without the ability to vet travelers the only way we can secure our nation from foreign threats is by constructing
